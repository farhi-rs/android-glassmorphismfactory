# android-glassmorphismfactory
Applying Glassmorphism effect now in your Android project is no nightmare using our library GlassmorphismFactory.

Infact, now it's easy as pressing a button.

Just link your [Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity) or your [Window](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Window) and your [View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View)s to GlassmorphismFactory, use setBlurRadius(View view, int radius) or setDefaultBlurRadius(int radius), link GlassmorphismFactory.BlurListener to your [View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View) | [View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View)s using setBlurListener(View view, BlurListener listener), call startGeneratingBlur() and tada ðŸŽ‰ you have successfully and easily applied Glassmorphism effect to your [View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View), how easy is that ðŸ˜€.

# How our library works

Our library uses [Android](https://github.com/android)'s [RenderScript Intrinsics Replacement Toolkit](https://github.com/android/renderscript-intrinsics-replacement-toolkit) library to blur the captured [View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View) background [Bitmap](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap) and give it to the user/developer through GlassmorphismFactory.BlurListener as a GlassmorphismDrawable and let the user/developer do whatever he want with it (set it as a background/foreground/draw it/set it for other views/apply color filter to it/apply rounded corners to it/ etc...).

Thanks to [Android](https://github.com/android) for providing this incredible library even though its in beta version ðŸ˜¶.
